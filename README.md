Try to build a dashboard:

At the local side, it tested successfully, 
Express.js(framework) + Node.js(local Environment for running JS) = server (in the project folder)
GraphiQL(like REST service) 
MySQL(local)


Might edit place:
Package.json
"homepage": "https://jerry93169.github.io/ReactDashboard",
“script”


plan:
try to connect my own supabase and import the data then i asked for the real supabase 
change my build into supabase version(right now it's mysql) 
also try to remain the local side(also connect to supabase) through GraphiQL
set the webpage on github or render(try to know the fauculty)
